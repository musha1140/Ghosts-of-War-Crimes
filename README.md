### Ghosts of War Crimes
Visualizing the devastating impacts of war crimes and crimes against humanity using interactive data visualizations and advanced filtering.

## Project Overview
This project enables users to explore datasets on war crimes and crimes against humanity, including incident details, responsible parties, and geospatial data. It features:
- Interactive filtering
- Geospatial visualizations using OpenStreetMap
- Parallel plots to analyze relationships between dimensions

### Features
1. **Data Upload**: Users can upload multiple CSV files for analysis.
2. **Interactive Filtering**: Filter data by location, incident type, and responsible parties.
3. **Visualizations**:
   - Animated scatter plots for temporal trends.
   - Interactive maps showing geolocated incidents.
   - Parallel plots for multidimensional analysis.

    <p>For all intents and purposes, his dashboard visualizes data sourced from publicly available reports and research. </p>
    <p>Reports and Research are sourced, or yet to be.</p>
    <p>Every party documented has been with the request of "Ghostwriting" software (named above)</p>
    <p>Even so, The LLMs were meant to only report facts, and even trunicated those with not as much</p>
  <p>Palestine</p> <!-- End of Vertical Self-Insert -->and other countries that are mentioned as an aggressor, or implied as such,, or any other "hot zone", Including both sies of the war in Ukraine, are met with an objective and unbiased approach. IRBMs will possibly be included if still used in the conflict. [example below]
  
  **Example of Verification Process**

To ensure the integrity of the data:

 <p> I watch the news on Feb 22nd 2022. I notice evacuation into subway footage. I also notice the weather, I do a quick weather search and find out there was none. Though I, myself, never even spoke on the matter publically or online. </p>
   A quick verification process was followed, such as checking claims like Ukraine “faking” snow in their footage during the 2022 conflict. This claim was easily debunked using a credible source: Reuters fact-check for recent evaluations:<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/image-of-polish-weather-map-engulfing-parts-of-ukraine-is-fake-idUSL1N34C1EB/">Reuters Report almost on the same matter. Though unnecessary  in their verdict , the information is still there.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/politics/fake-ukraine-videos-fact-check/index.html">CNN Report just 4 days after the war</a></p>

  With respect to those who were the victims of those alleged war crimes.

**Note:** Starting January 1, 2025, certain United States of America will *reinstate* broader free speech protections, aligning with federal standards. This application emphasizes the importance of data-driven transparency and accountability within this evolving legal landscape. The Roe v Wade overturn allowing states the dictation of such matters has double-edged effects.  The Anti-BDM Law will be discontinued. If you are unsure on the details of what territory is particpating in this freedom of speech reinstatement process, which has been punishing the free will to speak even with critical progressional unbias toward a matter for the greater good.
