# Ghosts of War Crimes
Visualizing the devastating impacts of war crimes and crimes against humanity using interactive data visualizations and advanced filtering.

## Project Overview
This project enables users to explore datasets on war crimes and crimes against humanity, including incident details, responsible parties, and geospatial data. It features:
- Interactive filtering
- Geospatial visualizations using OpenStreetMap
- Parallel plots to analyze relationships between dimensions

### Features
1. **Data Upload**: Users can upload multiple CSV files for analysis.
2. **Interactive Filtering**: Filter data by location, incident type, and responsible parties.
3. **Visualizations**:
   - Animated scatter plots for temporal trends.
   - Interactive maps showing geolocated incidents.
   - Parallel plots for multidimensional analysis.
